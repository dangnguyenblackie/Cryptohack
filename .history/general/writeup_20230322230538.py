# Quadratic Residues: square root modulo

This feels good, but now let's think about the square root of 18. From the above, we know we need to find some integer a such that a2 = 18

Your first idea might be to start with a = 1 and loop to a = p-1. In this discussion p isn't too large and we can quickly look.

Have a go, try coding this and see what you find. If you've coded it right, you'll find that for all a âˆˆ Fp* you never find an a such that a2 = 18.

            res += [items]
